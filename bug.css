The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors. The intention is to style the ".container" element, but due to the specificity of the child selector, the style is not applied as intended.  
```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue; 
}

.container p {
  color: red;  /*This selector is more specific*/
}

.container p {
    color: blue; /*This is not applied because of the above rule. */
}
```
